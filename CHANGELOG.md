### Changes

- **Massive** refactoring of code and general optimization, thanks to [boscojwho](https://github.com/boscojwho) on GitHub
    - Post views are now a bit prettier

    - Improved load time of the app (both from cold start and from background)
    - API request handler is now running in separate thread, which should speed up the app
