### Changes

- **Massive** refactoring of code and general optimization, thanks to [boscojwho](https://github.com/boscojwho) on GitHub
    - Post views are now a bit prettier
    - Replaced stock AsyncImage with Nuke
    - Improved load time of the app (both from cold start and from background)
    - API request handler is now running in separate thread, which should speed up the app
- 2FA key field is now always present in the login view (seems like some Lemmy instances change the response text when 2FA is enabled, so the app can't reliably detect if 2FA is enabled)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed notification counter not updating (#9)
- Unread message count should update, as soon as you reply to a message from the inbox
- Post creation popup content never gets cleared (#6)
- Fixed images in comments overflowing the comment box, if the image was placed in line with text
