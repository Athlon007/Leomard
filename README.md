#  Leomard

Leomard is a Lemmy client for macOS, written in Swift using SwiftUI. Leomard allows you to browse Lemmy instances, view posts and comments, and create new posts and comments, read replies, and more.

I made this app, because I do not like Lemmy's web interface, and I wanted to learn Swift. Besides, I like using native apps more than web apps.

This app is free and open source, is not affiliated with Lemmy or its developers, and it is developed in my free time. Please note that this app is still in early development, so bugs and issues are to be expected.

## Requirements

- macOS 13.1 Ventura or later
